**Project 1:** 1990 California Housing Prices

Credit: O'Reilly Hands-on ML Projects book, Chapter 2

**Overview:** The dataset contains the median housing prices of California in 1990 and 10 features that can be used to predict future prices. The data was visualized, prepped, and cleaned using packages from `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`, and analyzed using four supervised ML models (linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and SVM). Hyperparameters tuning was done by using `GridSearch` and `RandomSearch` on different hyperparameters combinations.
